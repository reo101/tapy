## Problem

Do you happen to have a huge collection of *favourited* (or *starred*, if you prefer) GIFs in Discord? Or maybe just hundreds of random photos in your Downloads directory?

Have you seen yourself in a situation where you need to quickly find a particular piece of media, let it be a GIF or a video, but just couldn't find it in your enormous arsenal?

Look no further - Tapy is here!

Tapy is a tool for tagging and quickly accessing all kinds of media. Just open it up, write a few keywords into the search box and voil√† - everything is now filtered to only show media that matches your search tags.

Tapy consists of a backend and frontend server.
